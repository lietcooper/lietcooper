My name is Lijun Wan and you may call me Lite! I’m a self-motivated software engineer specializing in backend development, large-scale systems, and cloud infrastructure. As an SDE intern, I’ve built and shipped Spring Boot microservices, configured CI/CD pipelines in Azure DevOps, and improved test coverage and reliability in real-world production environments.

I’m currently pursuing an MS in Computer Science at Northeastern University, focusing on distributed systems and intelligent agents. I enjoy designing services that are reliable, observable, and maintainable.
